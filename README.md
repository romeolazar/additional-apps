## Info
Because all the services are setup with `docker-compose` they can all reach each other by their Docker Compose service name. So for example when connecting Sonarr with Jacket or qBittorrent, then Jackett would be available on `http://jackett/api....`, which makes everything a lot easier.

### Edit the .env file
All configuration to this setup, I've put in the `.env` file, so all you have to do is go through it and edit it to fit your needs.
